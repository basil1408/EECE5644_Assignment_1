Intro to ML Assignment 1

Q2: Real-valued measurement x is generated by one of two equally probable probability
density functions (pdfs)
    Q2.3 Matlab code for plot of log-likelihood-ratio function for the case a1 = 0;b1 = 1 and a2 =1;b2 = 2 and x in the range of -100 to
        100
Q4: Two-class setting with equal class priors and a real-valued feature with Gaussian class-conditioned pdfs N (0;1) and N (m;s2).
    Q4.2 For the case m =1 and (sigma)^2 =2 generate plots that visualize the class-conditional pdfs p(x|L=l) for l = 1, 2, as well as
        class posterior probabilities p(L = l|x) for l = 1, 2. Demonstrate the decision boundary you found earlier in these visualizations.
